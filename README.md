# Common MongoDB Errors in Node.js

This repository demonstrates common errors that can occur when working with MongoDB in a Node.js environment, along with solutions to address them.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases some of the following issues:

* **Improper error handling**: The code only throws an error rather than handling it gracefully.
* **Implicit null checks**: Assuming the document exists without explicitly checking.
* **Unsafe property access**: Attempting to access properties without verifying they exist.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides improved code that addresses these issues and makes the application more robust and reliable.
